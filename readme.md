# TI-Basic Calculator Programs

Here is a collection of half finished mix of TI-Basic programs I've created over the years. Most of the programs are designed specifically for TI-84 Plus CE, but there's a few TI-84 Plus ones in there. Go wild my friends.

Click [HERE](https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/users/TI_84_Coder) for a full list of my finished but admittedly barely maintained projects at Cemetech. Great guys if you're interesting in learning more about Calculators and other niche coding projects. [TI-Basic Dev](http://tibasicdev.wikidot.com/) is also great, basically a complete documentation on TI-Basic.

## Installation
Crash course for installing these projects for the uninitiated, basically everything revolves around Texas Instruments's [**TI-Connect**](https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-sw), their IDE for Basic projects. Their you can use a mini-usb cable to connect your computer to the port on calculator and upload files.
