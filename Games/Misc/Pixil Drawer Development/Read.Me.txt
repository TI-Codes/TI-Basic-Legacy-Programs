*Thank you for downloading PXL-DRAW CE v1.0 for the TI-84 CE!*


    	PXL-DRAW CE allows you to draw characters, sprites, or just pixel art without squinting at the screen. You can easily set your grid size (min: 2x2, max: 23x24), switch between colors, and draw and delete pixels without any issue. Watch your drawing as a real-time scale model also draws next to your grid. PXL-DRAW CE quickly converts your drawing into one of 3 local list saves, which can easily be accessed and used by a user in their game or other projects!
    
	If you do use this program to create sprites or elements for your game, please cite PXL-DRAW CE somewhere within your program with the following:
