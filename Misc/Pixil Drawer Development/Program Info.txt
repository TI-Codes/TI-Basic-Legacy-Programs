[INSTALLATION]
	After installing the TI Connect CE (Download Link: https://education.ti.com/en/products/computer-software/ti-connect-ce-sw), send the program 'PXL-DRAW CE' to your calculator. If you plan on transferring files often, I recomend downloading 'PDCE Diagnostic' as well.


[CONTROLS]
	Within the initial set up: 'clear' returns you to the previous screen and 'enter' to select.
	Within the drawing: 'F1' chooses a new color, 'F2' resets the grid, 'F3' saves and quits, '2nd' draws the pixel, and 'del' deletes the selected pixel.


[DECLUTTERING]
	Occurs in rare cases, usually, when you have been working on drawing for a significant amount of time, the list will reach its maximum size of 999. Decluttering goes through the list and rids of any unnecessary numbers. It takes a minute to process, so please be patient while it processes.


[SAVES]
	There are three local saves within the program (LPDS1, LPDS2, LPDS3) which are stored in lists. While the program only can read and save at these three lists, the user is not limited to only 3 saves.     
    
	[SAVES: Transferring]
    	To store a save, select the save you wish to store (2nd, stat), then store it, beginning with whichever combination of a max of 5 letters/numbers.
    	INCORRECT: LPDS1 -> 1DRAW    
   	INCORRECT: LPDS1 -> DRAWING1
    	CORRECT: LPDS1 -> DRAW1
    	To edit a transferred file, it must be retransferred to a readable save file (LPDS1, LPDS2, LPDS3). Make sure the save file is empty before transferring in new files.


[SAVE BREAKDOWN]
	Each number in a LPDS file, a PXL number, represents a pixel's color and location.
	PXL number: {131903}
   		-Color: Magenta (13)
   		-Row: 19
   		-Column: 3
To access each one, use the follow code:
	PXL number: {131903}
    		-Color: int([VALUE]/1E4 )| int(131903/1E4) = 13
    		-Row: int([VALUE]/1E2)-[COLOR CODE VALUE]E2) | int(131903/1E2)-13E2) = 19
    		-Column: 100fPart([VALUE]/1E2) | 100fPart(131903/1E2) = 3
The last number in a LPDS save is for the PXL-DRAW prgm, the DIM number, which it uses to determine the grid size for that save. 
	DIM number: {900213}
    	-Placeholder: 90
    	-Row: 2
    	-Column: 13
If you are using this list for sprite animation, remember to remove the DIM number or it may interfer with your program.

[ERRORS]
	There are 2 potential errors, all of which most likely will occur when transferring save files to LPDS files: [DIM ERROR] and [PXL ERROR]. While there are errors within PXL-DRAW CE, I recomend using 'PDCE Diagnostic' for larger files.
    
    	[DIM ERROR]
    	Occurs when there is an issue with the DIM number within the selected LPDS file.
    		-No DIM number: LPDS1 = {140513,121902,121817,[ ]}
    		-Invalid DIM number: LPDS1 = {140513,121902,121817,[2357430]} | LPDS1 = {140513,121902,121817,[8709]}
    		-DIM number outside Domain (R: 2-23, C:2-24): LPDS1 = {140513,121902,121817,[909901] | Row = 99, Column = 1

    	[PXL ERROR]
    	Occurs when there is an issue with a PXL number within the selected LPDS file. 
    		-No PXL number: LPDS1 = {140513,[0],121817}
    		-Invalid PXL number: LPDS1 = {[23948],90202} | LPDS1 = {[384],90202}
    		-Invalid Color code (CC: 10-24): LPDS1 = {[88]0513,90202} | LPDS1 = {[1]0513,90202}
   		-Invalid Row (R:2-23): {14[00]13,90202} | LPDS1 = {14[67]13,90202}
    		-Invalid Column (C:2-24): {1405[00],90202} | LPDS1 = {1405[67],90202}


[PDCE Diagnostic]
	PDCE Diagnostic (prgmPDDgnstc) is a very simple program that has compiled all of the potential errors into one program. Just store the desired file to LD and run it. It will return any errors, if any, on an easy to read display. This way, it's easier to see if any mistakes have been made.
